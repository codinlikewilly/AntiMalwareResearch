Dependencies:
	1. Python 3.7 (32 bit) - https://www.python.org/downloads/
	2. BioPython - https://biopython.org/wiki/Download
	3. NUMPY - https://scipy.org/install.html

Setup:
	1. Install Python 3.7 (32-bit) with IDLE
	2. Pip install BioPython and Numpy
	3. Install ClamAV 

	

Execution:
	1. Open the RunMeCustom.py file in IDLE (32-bit)
	2. Run the module
	3. Select two files to compare in the GUI 
	4. Sequence files by pressing "Sequence" button 
	5. record the generated meta-signature
	6. in a text editor create a yara based rule for ClamAV 
		6a. See https://www.clamav.net/documents/extended-signature-format
	7. save the file as a .ndb file and place in the clamAV/database/ folder
	8. Run ClamScan using custom signature 
		8a. in a command prompt navigate to clamAV installation 
		8b. run scan using  clamscan -d (filepath to file containing custom signature) (filepath of folder to traverse and scan )
	

Files:
	artifacts/data - contains files that contain harmless code that is similar to malicious code
	as well as mine.ndb which contains the meta-signature that I generated using the prescribed method. 
	the mine.ndb file can be placed in the "databases" folder of your clamav installation and used to detect
	morphed versions of the EICAR test virus. 

	artifacts/misc - contains windows installer for open source ClamAV 
	
	artifacts/results - contains screenshots of results of scans using ClamAV main database and scans using
	the extended meta-signature.
